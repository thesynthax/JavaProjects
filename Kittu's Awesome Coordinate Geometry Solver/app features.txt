APP FEATURES:

1. plotting of curves
2. identification of type of curve (line, circle, para, ellp, hyp etc)
3. properties of curve (line - slope, x-y intercepts etc, circle - center, radius etc, hyp - foci, dir, aux circle, asymptote etc)
4. parametric plotting of curve (para - x=2at, y=at^2, circle - x=rcost, y=rsint etc)
5. identification of bijective, non-bijective functions (one-one, many-one, onto, into)
6. equation solving
7. min distance b/w two curves
8. common tangents, normals of two curves
9. rotation of curves by dragging or entering and angle

ambitious targets:
1. functional eqn solving
2. complex plane
3. calculus (limits, diff, int)
4. finding the curve via calculus operations
5. application of derivatives
6. differential eqns
